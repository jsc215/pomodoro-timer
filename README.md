### The Pomodoro Technique

From Wikipedia:
> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This particular timer is set up to work for four 25 minute intervals that are followed by a 5-minute break. After the fifth 25-minute work interval there is a 15-minute break and the process automatically resets.
